# Amiga-C64-SID-song-player

This plays C64's SID songs on the Amiga with playsid.library

You'll need PlaySID3.lha archive to use this code.
The archive can be found in the Aminet:
https://aminet.net/package/mus/play/PlaySID3

This program uses the playsid.library and the include files
that come with the archive.

Furthermore, in order to play the C64's SID files,
you'll need to use the SIDConv tool of PlaySID3 archive to
convert the .sid files into two (2) files like this:

SIDConv yoursidfile.sid yoursidfile ICON

More info in the PlaySID3 archive.

NOTICE!!

I noticed, that this program nor does the PlaySID3.0 handle
C64 songs, that have digitzed instruments!


I'll try to find the time to improve this code...
